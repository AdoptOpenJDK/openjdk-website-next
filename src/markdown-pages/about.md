## Background
AdoptOpenJDK.net started in 2017 following years of discussions about the general lack of an open and reproducible build & test system for OpenJDK source across multiple platforms.

AdoptOpenJDK provides rock-solid OpenJDK binaries for the Java ecosystem and also provides [infrastructure as code](https://www.github.com/AdoptOpenJDK){target="_blank"}, and a [Build farm](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/){target="_blank"} for builders of OpenJDK, on any platform.

## Our Mission
1. Provide a reliable source of OpenJDK binaries for all platforms, for the long term future!
1. Enable R&D by OpenJDK developers, academics and researchers.
1. Provide an open, common, audited, build infrastructure for vendors to use (if they wish).
1. Provide a place to try out build and test infrastructure ideas that could be co-opted / re-implemented in OpenJDK.

## Who's behind the AdoptOpenJDK.net Community?
[AdoptOpenJDK](https://community.oracle.com/community/java/jcp/adopt-openjdk){target="_blank"} is a community of Java User Group (JUG) members, Java developers and vendors (including Azul, Amazon, GoDaddy, IBM, jClarity, Microsoft, Pivotal and Red Hat) who are advocates of [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/){target="_blank"}, the open source project which forms the basis of the Java programming language and platform. The group also has other activities which you can discover in the [Adoption Group](https://openjdk.java.net/groups/adoption/){target="_blank"} at [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/){target="_blank"}.

See our [Sponsors](./sponsors) page for a subset of the vendors that are involved.
