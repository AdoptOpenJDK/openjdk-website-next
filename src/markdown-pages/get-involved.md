## I'm a Java / OpenJDK User
We provide rock-solid binaries to the highest quality possible utilising existing OpenJDK test suites (via *jtreg* tests, *jcov* test coverage et al) and over 60,000 other OSS donated test suites. See [Support](./support) for community and commercial support options.

### Available Platforms
We currently support ARM 32/64 (aarch 32/64), Linux x64, Windows, Solaris, MacOS and several other Linux variants including PPC and AIX.

## I'm an OpenJDK Developer
We provide [infrastructure as code](https://www.github.com/AdoptOpenJDK){target="_blank"}, and a [Build and test farm](https://www.github.com/AdoptOpenJDK){target="_blank"} for OpenJDK developers. A future version of this build farm will act as a patch submission mechanism for OpenJDK developers to submit, review and test patches for multiple platforms **before** submitting to the [OpenJDK project](https://openjdk.java.net/){target="_blank"}.

### Source Forests
We've started with jdk8u and jdk11u with test coverage from the open jtreg tests, providing jcov test coverage reports. Later on other popular forests such as valhalla etc will be added.

There may be some areas of overlap with other past/present efforts, but that's OK. We expect any duplication to converge in due course and have started working with other platform specific OpenJDK build efforts.

## I'm a Web Developer
The website is fully open-source, and contributions are welcome! Get involved by forking the [openjdk-website repository](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-website){target="_blank"} on GitHub.

The [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-website/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md){target="_blank"} is regularly updated, and should help to get you up and running.
